# product-page-shopify

This is a code test for Supadu showing a product detail page.

The link for the Shopify preview: 

https://yilpkvr6t81q0yfg-47551709342.shopifypreview.com 

I stored the data in the metafields of the page and created a new product layout from scratch. I focused on showing the data correctly and having a clean layout. There is also some basic show/hide for the summary and author bio using jQuery.
