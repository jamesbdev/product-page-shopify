# product-page-shopify

This is a code test for Supadu showing a product detail page.

The link for the Shopify preview: 

https://yilpkvr6t81q0yfg-47551709342.shopifypreview.com 

I stored the data in the metafields of the page and created a new product layout from scratch. I focused on showing the data correctly and having a clean layout. There is also some basic show/hide for the summary and author bio using jQuery.

The code I've added can be found in the page.liquid in templates folder. And the styles can be found at the bottom of the theme.scss.liquid in assets folder.
